# Shaastra_Reverse_Coding_2022
Repository for IIT Madras' Shaastra 2022 event Reverse Coding

## About the Competition

* Contestants will be given the executable (for Linux, Windows and Mac OS).
* They then have to provide input to the executable and find out what each part of the program does.
* The contestants then have to write code (in Python/C++) that exactly replicates what the executable does.
* If the executable and the contestant's output corresponding to each (hidden) input match, they are awarded points.
* For MacOS users, download the zip file and run the executable. This may generate an error. Hence follow the steps below:

    1. Open the executable and once it shows the error, click OK.
    1. Then click System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> General tab -> Open Anyways.
* For Linux users, open the terminal and go the directory same as that of the executable.

    1. Run the executable as `./Finals_Linux`.
    1. If it throws an error, give it executable rights using `sudo chmod 700 Finals_Linux`. Give your username and password as required. Now run it again.
